# demo_pipeline

This is a quickie sample repo to show how one might build a data pipeline using Pydantic and SQL Alchemy

## Why Pydantic?
* Serves as built-in documentation of what form data is expected in
* Provides type hints as you're working with the models
* Allows you to build in custom validation against each item you're processing

## Why SQLAlchemy?
* I'd rather work with an ORM than raw SQL
